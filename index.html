                            Origin of the internet traces back to the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). It was the first wide-area packet-switched network with distributed control and one of the first computer networks to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. Both technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet. ARPANET's main use was for academic and research purposes.

                            In 1971, Ray Tomlinson, a computer engineer made history by inventing the email system as we know it today. Tomlinson’s groundbreaking work allowed for messages to be transmitted between computers connected to the ARPANET, a forerunner to the modern internet. By ingeniously utilizing the “@” symbol to distinguish the user’s name from the computer’s name, Tomlinson established a standardized addressing system for electronic messages. This game-changing innovation transformed communication by enabling individuals to send messages instantaneously across vast distances, laying the foundation for the interconnected world we inhabit today.

                            <p>Archie could not search for content within web pages and would index only specific file formats. But it laid the groundwork for more advanced search engines of the 90s, like Gopher, Veronika, and Jughead, that began to index content on the web. They all led to landmark search engines, such as Web Crawler (1994), Lycos (1994), Alta Vista (1995), and eventually Google (1998)</p>

                            <p>The first web page provided an overview of the WWW project, an explanation of hypertext, and instructions on how to create web pages. It also introduced hyperlinks that allowed users to navigate between web pages by clicking on text and images.

                            <p>The early 1990s marked a turning point when governments realized the internet was more than just technical infrastructure. They saw its far-reaching implications and began developing more comprehensive policies and frameworks for internet governance, regulation, and international cooperation. This shift was aimed at fostering the internet's continued growth and security as it was embraced globally.</p>

                            <p>Google began as an online search firm, but it now offers more than 50 Internet services and products, from e-mail and online document creation to software for mobile phones and tablet computers.</p>
                            <p>Google’s broad product portfolio and size make it one of the top four influential companies in the high-tech marketplace, along with Apple, IBM, and Microsoft.</p>

                            <p>The dotcom bubble was a rapid rise in U.S. technology stock equity valuations fueled by investments in Internet-based companies in the late 1990s.</p>
                            <p>The value of equity markets grew exponentially during the dotcom bubble, with the Nasdaq rising from under 1,000 to more than 5,000 between 1995 and 2000. Things started to change in 2000, and the bubble burst between 2001 and 2002 with equities entering a bear market.</p>
                            <p>The crash that followed saw the Nasdaq index, which rose five-fold between 1995 and 2000, tumble from a peak of 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000, to 1,139.90 on Oct. 4, 2002, a 76.81% fall. By the end of 2001, most dotcom stocks went bust. Even the share prices of blue-chip technology stocks like Cisco, Intel, and Oracle lost more than 80% of their value. It would take 15 years for the Nasdaq to regain its peak, which it did on April 24, 2015.</p>

                                <p>Social media platforms flourished and expanded their user base, smart technologies evolved, and e-commerce partly replaced regular shopping. This age saw the rise of influencer culture, streaming services, viral trends, mobile games, and the development of AI technologies, setting the trend for the future.</p>

                                <h3>Pandemic</h3>
                                <p>While our dependence on the internet was significant for both daily and professional purposes before the onset of Covid-19, it heightened even further during the pandemic. With Covid-19 emerging at the close of 2019, it prompted widespread lockdowns worldwide throughout 2020 and 2021. This, in turn, brought about a sustained era of social distancing, remote work, and a shift of our social interactions to online platforms.</p>

                                <h3>Remote work and Learning</h3>
                                <p>During the pandemic, people shifted to working, learning, communicating, and entertaining themselves from home through online tools. Platforms such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet facilitated remote work, while educational institutions embraced e-learning platforms like Google Classroom or Microsoft Teams. Virtual classrooms and webinars became the norm. Simultaneously, with the rise in internet speed and widespread adoption of 5G, global connectivity is anticipated to expand, leading to the growth of the Internet of Things, connecting more devices and enabling smart vehicles, homes, cities, and industries. This surge in connectivity and smart device usage will necessitate enhanced security and privacy solutions.</p>
                                <p>Furthermore, the landscape of entertainment and work processes is expected to evolve with virtual reality and augmented reality technologies, transforming the way we work, consume content, and interact online. The ascent of artificial intelligence will also play a pivotal role in shaping the future of the internet.</p>
